1) What is Power BI and how does it differ from Excel?

Ans: Power BI is a business intelligence tool for dashboards and reporting. Excel is mainly for spreadsheets and manual analysis. Power BI is better for automation, visuals, and large data.

2) Explain the concept of data modeling in Power BI.

Ans: Data modeling means connecting tables using relationships so the data works together for analysis.

3) What are the different types of connections available in Power BI?

Ans:

Import

DirectQuery

Live Connection

Composite Model

4) How do you handle data transformation in Power BI?

Ans: Using Power Query Editor (clean, filter, merge, replace values, remove errors).

5) What is DAX and why is it important in Power BI?

Ans: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used to create measures and calculated columns.

6) Difference between calculated columns and measures?

Ans:

Calculated Column: Calculated row-by-row and stored in the model.

Measure: Calculated during visualization (dynamic).

7) How do you handle relationships between tables in Power BI?

Ans: Creating relationships using keys (1-to-many, many-to-one) and setting cross-filter direction.

8) What is the purpose of a Power BI Gateway?

Ans: It connects on-premise data sources to the Power BI cloud for automatic refresh.

9) How can you schedule data refresh in Power BI Service?

Ans: Go to dataset → Settings → Schedule Refresh → Set time and frequency.

10) Explain row-level security in Power BI.

Ans: RLS restricts data for specific users by applying filters to roles.

11) What is Power BI Desktop and how does it differ from Power BI Service?

Ans:

Desktop: Build reports.

Service: Share, publish, and manage dashboards online.

12) Explain DirectQuery in Power BI.

Ans: DirectQuery keeps data in the source and queries it live without importing.

13) What are Power BI templates and how are they useful?

Ans: Templates (.pbit) store report layout and queries without data; useful for reuse.

14) How do you handle incremental data refresh in Power BI?

Ans: Use Incremental Refresh Policy on datasets to refresh only new/changed data.

15) What is the role of Power Query in Power BI?

Ans: It is used for extracting, cleaning, and transforming data before loading.

16) Difference between calculated columns and calculated tables?

Ans:

Calculated Column: Adds new column to an existing table.

Calculated Table: Creates an entire new table using DAX.

17) How do you create custom visuals in Power BI?

Ans: Import visuals from Power BI Visuals Marketplace or create using Power BI Developer Tools.

18) Best practices for optimizing performance in Power BI?

Ans:

Reduce data model size

Use star schema

Avoid too many visuals

Use measures, not calculated columns

Optimize DAX

19) How do you integrate Power BI with Microsoft products like Azure & Office 365?

Ans: Power BI connects using connectors such as Azure SQL, Azure Data Lake, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Teams.

20) Explain aggregations in Power BI.

Ans: Aggregations summarize large tables (sum, count, avg) to improve report performance.

21) How do you handle error handling and data quality in Power BI?

Ans: Use Power Query options: Remove Errors, Replace Values, Data Type check, Profiling tools.

22) What is Power BI Embedded and when would you use it?

Ans: It allows embedding Power BI reports inside custom applications. Used by developers for customer-facing analytics
